# Gmail Usage Analysis

**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze the usage patterns, email content, and communication trends within my Gmail account. By examining metadata (not the email content itself for privacy), the project will extract insights into productivity, communication habits, and potential areas for improvement.

## Data Source

- **Dataset**: Exported email metadata from Gmail (Google Takeout service).
- **Fields**:
  - **Timestamps**: Sent/received times of emails.
  - **Sender/Recipient Metadata**: Email addresses or domains.
  - **Labels**: Categories like Inbox, Spam, Promotions, etc.
  - **Subject Line Keywords**: Extracted for topic analysis.
  - **Thread Lengths**: Number of emails in conversations.

Data privacy is maintained by avoiding analysis of email body content or personal attachments.

## Objectives

1. **Email Traffic Analysis**: Examine the volume of emails sent/received over time and identify peak communication periods.
2. **Topic Trends**: Use subject line analysis to uncover common topics or keywords.
3. **Sender Analysis**: Identify top senders/recipients and analyze the type of communication (e.g., personal vs. professional).
4. **Time Management Insights**: Determine email response times and patterns to evaluate productivity.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Export Gmail metadata via Google Takeout and preprocess it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize trends in email traffic.
   - Identify key communication partners and response times.
3. **Text Analysis**:
   - Perform keyword extraction on subject lines.
   - Group emails into clusters based on topics using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Examine trends in email traffic over days, weeks, and months.
5. **Visualization**: Create dashboards showing communication trends and productivity insights.
